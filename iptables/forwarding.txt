
for enable forwarding need following


sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1				// temporary enabling this rule until reboot



For persistent you need change conf file:

/etc/sysctl.conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1						// persistent enabling this rule after reboot



sudo sysctl -p 							//allow enabling this rule without reboot 



sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE	//enable NAT for ip from DHCP

sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i enp0s3 -o enp0s8 -m conntrack
--ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT				//enable only for packets that RELATED and ESTABLISHED, from outside to inside 


sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i enp0s8 -o enp0s3 -j ACCEPT		//enable for all packet, from inside to outside
